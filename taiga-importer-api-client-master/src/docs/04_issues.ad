== Issue migration

Once you have created a project, you can now import issues related with this project:

[source, groovy]
.Issue.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/net/kaleidos/domain/Issue.groovy[tags=issue,indent=0]
----


[source, groovy]
.Basic issue creation
----
include::{testDir}/net/kaleidos/taiga/testdata/IssueData.groovy[tags=createIssue,indent=0]
----

Now you can import the issue in Taiga:

[source, groovy]
----
issue = taigaClient.createIssue(issue)
----

The `issue` instance is populated with all the information returned from Taiga after the issue creation.

You can also include attachments, set the owner, the creation date, the finished date, the assigned to user, the history of changes and the tags.
Please, check https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-importer-api-client/blob/master/src/test/groovy/net/kaleidos/taiga/IssueTaigaSpec.groovy[the tests^] to see other examples.
