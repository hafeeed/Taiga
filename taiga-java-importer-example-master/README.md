# Taiga Java Importer example

This a simple project example of how to use the [Taiga Importer API Client](https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-importer-api-client) from a Java application. Although the API client has been developed with Groovy, you can use it from Java without problems.

To run the project, execute:

```
./gradlew run
```

The project will create a new project in your local Taiga installation (in http://localhost:8000), print the project data and finally delete it.
